The utility model discloses a distributed wind-solar complementary air purification device, comprising a base in the shape of a rectangular box with openings at both ends. A dust collection frame is fixedly connected to the lower part of the base, while a wind-solar power generation unit is mounted on the upper part. Inside the base, multiple discharge adsorption plates are arranged side by side for discharging and adsorbing particulate matter. Above these plates and within the dust collection frame, a cleaning frame is provided to remove accumulated particles. An exhaust fan is installed on one side of the discharge adsorption plates within the base, and filter plates are positioned at both the air inlet and outlet of the base. A drawer is also slidably connected inside the dust collection frame for collecting dust. This device utilizes solar energy and wind pressure generated by passing vehicles to power its operation, enabling efficient purification of roadside air in an energy-saving and environmentally friendly manner.
