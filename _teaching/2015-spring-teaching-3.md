The invention discloses an experimental measurement device for radon exhalation from fissures in radioactive beach surfaces. The device comprises a sealed shell, inside which a feed bin for holding radioactive tailings sand is placed on the bottom plate. A sunlight simulation system is installed on the sidewall of the shell, and a digital imaging system for capturing fissure development is mounted on the top of the shell, aligned with the upper opening of the feed bin. Outside the shell, a wind flow simulation system and a radon concentration measurement system are arranged and connected to the internal space of the shell. The device also includes a control and processing system for managing the operation of all subsystems. This device simulates the evolution of radioactive beach surfaces under atmospheric environmental conditions, enabling experimental measurements of fissure development and changes in radon exhalation rates. The resulting data supports the development of correlation models, which help reduce environmental pollution and prevent safety hazards to surrounding populations. The invention further discloses an experimental method for measuring radon exhalation from fissures in radioactive beach surfaces using the described device.
