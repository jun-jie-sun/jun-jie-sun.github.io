The utility model discloses a safety emergency device for nuclear power reactors. The device comprises a steam generator connected to a cooling pipe installed inside a water-cooled box via a pressure relief pipe. A remotely adjustable safety valve is mounted on the pressure relief pipe. The cooling pipe is further connected to an external discharge tank through a discharge pipe. The water-cooled box is connected to an external air-cooled tower via a water inlet pipe and an exhaust pipe, and is equipped with a drain pipe for water discharge.This device can prevent the rupture of heat transfer tubes in the steam generator, thereby avoiding nuclear contamination. Additionally, it can regulate the internal pressure of the safety shell when it rises, enabling the safety valve to open smoothly for pressure relief.
