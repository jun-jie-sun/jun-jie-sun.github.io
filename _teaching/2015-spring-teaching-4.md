The present invention discloses an intrinsically safe emergency lighting device based on the tunnel piston effect, comprising a lamp bead, a power system, and a switching system, the switching system being connected in series between the lamp bead and the power system. The power system comprises a battery mounted within the shell of the lighting lamp and a power supply module that provides power to the lamp; the switching system is configured to switch between the battery and the power supply module to supply power to the lamp bead. A power detector is installed on the battery to monitor its power level in real time. When the battery is in a low-power state, it is given charging priority while ensuring the normal operation of the lighting lamp. This ensures that the battery remains fully charged at all times, avoids power loss during emergencies, and further enhances the stability of the lighting lamp.
