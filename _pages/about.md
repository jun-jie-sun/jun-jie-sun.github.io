I'm a second-year Master's Degree Candidate at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in plasma physics, with an expected graduation date of June 2026. My research interests lie in particle–material interactions, particle transport simulation, and the application of machine learning in physical experiments and simulations.

Academic performance
======
During my undergraduate studies, my overall academic performance is equivalent to or above the level of a UK 2:1 Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification), and I graduated with a GPA of 3.69 out of 5.00, with an average score of 87.02/100, ranking 1st among 98 students in the program. 

During my master's studies, my overall academic performance is equivalent to or above the level of a UK 2:1 Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification), and I graduated with a GPA of 3.37 out of 4.3, with an average score of about 85/100.



Research Experience
======

1. Innovative Works Design Competitions: I have participated in various innovative works design competitions held in China. The innovative devices involved during the competition include : a traffic tunnel power generation device for safe emergency power supply, a green power generation device based on road tunnel traffic flow, a pressure difference sensing regeneration green power supply device based on liquid pipe network, and a nuclear power reactor safety emergency device, helping me win 3 provincial or national awards、 nearly 10 school-level awards and apply for 3 patents successfully.
1. Mathematical Modeling Competitions: I have participated in many domestic and international mathematical modeling competitions, been exposed to various hot research issues in interdisciplinary fields, and utilized simulation and machine learning methods to solve these problems. At that time, it had already won the second prize at the school level in the National Competition of China and the F Award (the highest award nomination) in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling of the United States, which set a new record for the highest award in the school at that time.
1. Scientific Research Experiment: During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Hunan Provincial Engineering Research Center for Uranium Tailings Pond Decommissioning and Treatment Technology and participated in the research on the treatment and utilization of tailings ponds. I successfully applied for one invention patent and published one sci paper finally. During the postgraduate stage, I joined the Neutral Beam Injection Laboratory of Hefei Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and engaged in the research on the particle evolution characteristics of the CRAFT-NNBI electro-deflectors. One sci paper has been published so far (minor revision pending acceptance), and one invention patent has been applied for (pending public release).

Future Plan
======
I aim to pursue a fully funded PhD program in physics or a closely related interdisciplinary field, such as machine learning for particle-material interactions. Building upon my academic training and research experience in plasma physics and numerical simulations, my goal is to contribute to fundamental understanding and practical modeling of energetic particle interactions with materials, particularly in fusion energy and advanced manufacturing contexts. In the coming years, I plan to deepen my expertise in multi-scale simulation methods (e.g., PIC, MD, MC), strengthen my mathematical and computational skills, and explore the integration of AI-based approaches into physical modeling. Ultimately, I hope to develop innovative tools and solutions that address critical scientific and engineering challenges while growing as a capable and collaborative researcher in an international environment.
