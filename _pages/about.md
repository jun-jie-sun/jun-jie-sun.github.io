I'm a second-year master's degree student at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in plasma physics, with an expected graduation date of June 2026. My research interests lie in particle–material interactions, particle transport simulation, and the application of machine learning in physical experiments and simulations.

Academic performance
======
Throughout my undergraduate years, my overall academic performance is equivalent to or above the level of a UK 2:1 Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification), and I graduated with a GPA of 3.69 out of 5.00, with an average score of 87.02/100, ranking 1st among 98 students in the program. 

While pursuing my master’s degree, my overall academic performance is equivalent to or above the level of a UK 2:1 Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification), and I graduated with a GPA of 3.37 out of 4.3, with an average score of about 85/100.



Research Experience
======
1. Innovative Works Design Competitions: I have actively engaged in numerous innovative works design competitions in China. My participation has yielded a range of inventive devices, such as a traffic tunnel power generation device for safe emergency power supply, a green power generation device based on road tunnel traffic flow, a pressure difference sensing regeneration green power supply device based on liquid pipe network, and a nuclear power reactor safety emergency device. These achievements have earned me 3 provincial or national awards, nearly 10 school-level awards, and successfully led to the application for 3 patents.
1. Mathematical Modeling Competitions: I have actively participated in various domestic and international mathematical modeling competitions, gaining valuable experience in analyzing interdisciplinary research problems. By applying simulation techniques and machine learning algorithms, I was able to develop effective solutions to complex challenges. My achievements include the Second Prize at the university level in the National Mathematical Modeling Competition of China, as well as the F Award (Finalist Award Nomination for Outstanding Performance) in The Mathematical Contest in Modeling and The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) in the United States — a record for the highest award ever achieved at my university at the time.
1. Scientific Research Experiment: During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Hunan Provincial Engineering Research Center for Uranium Tailings Pond Decommissioning and Treatment Technology and participated in the research on the treatment and utilization of tailings ponds. I successfully applied for one invention patent and published one sci paper finally. During the postgraduate stage, I joined the Neutral Beam Injection Laboratory of Hefei Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and engaged in the research on the particle evolution characteristics of the CRAFT-NNBI electro-deflectors. One sci paper has been published so far (minor revision pending acceptance), and one invention patent has been applied for (pending public release).

Future Plan
======
I aim to pursue a fully funded PhD program in physics or a closely related interdisciplinary field, such as machine learning for particle-material interactions. Building upon my academic training and research experience in plasma physics and numerical simulations, my goal is to contribute to fundamental understanding and practical modeling of energetic particle interactions with materials, particularly in fusion energy and advanced manufacturing contexts. In the coming years, I plan to deepen my expertise in multi-scale simulation methods (e.g., PIC, MD, MC), strengthen my mathematical and computational skills, and explore the integration of AI-based approaches into physical modeling. Ultimately, I hope to develop innovative tools and solutions that address critical scientific and engineering challenges while growing as a capable and collaborative researcher in an international environment.
