I'm a second-year Master's Degree Candidate at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in plasma physics, with an expected graduation date of June 2026. My research interests lie in particle–material interactions, particle transport simulation, and the application of machine learning in physical experiments and simulations.

Academic performance
======
During my undergraduate studies, my overall academic performance is equivalent to or above the level of a UK 2:1 Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification), and I graduated with a GPA of 3.69 out of 5.00, with an average score of 87.02/100, ranking 1st among 98 students in the program. 

During my master's studies, my overall academic performance is equivalent to or above the level of a UK 2:1 Honours degree (or an equivalent qualification), and I graduated with a GPA of 3.37 out of 4.3, with an average score of about 85/100.



Research Experience
======

1. Innovative Works Design Competitions:

   I have participated in various innovative works design competitions held in China. The innovative devices involved during the competition include : a traffic tunnel power generation device for safe emergency power supply, a green power generation device based on road tunnel traffic flow, a pressure difference sensing regeneration green power supply device based on liquid pipe network, and a nuclear power reactor safety emergency device, helping me win 3 provincial or national awards、 nearly 10 school-level awards and apply for 3 patents successfully.
1. Mathematical Modeling Competitions: I have participated in many domestic and international mathematical modeling competitions, been exposed to various hot research issues in interdisciplinary fields, and utilized simulation and machine learning methods to solve these problems. At that time, it had already won the second prize at the school level in the National Competition of China and the F Award (the highest award nomination) in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling of the United States, which set a new record for the highest award in the school at that time.
1. Scientific Research Experiment: During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Hunan Provincial Engineering Research Center for Uranium Tailings Pond Decommissioning and Treatment Technology and participated in the research on the treatment and utilization of tailings ponds. I successfully applied for one invention patent and published one sci paper finally. 

Skills and abilities
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Future Plan
======
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
