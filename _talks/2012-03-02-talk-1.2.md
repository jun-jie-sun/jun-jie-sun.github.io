The National College Students’ Energy-Saving and Emission-Reduction Social Practice and Science & Technology Competition is a prestigious innovation and social practice event for university students in China, organized by the National Organizing Committee under the guidance of the Teaching Steering Committee for Energy and Power of the Ministry of Education. As one of the most influential competitions in Chinese higher education, it focuses on key national priorities such as the “Dual Carbon” (carbon peaking and carbon neutrality) strategy. With strong support from the Ministry of Education and active participation from universities across the country, the competition has developed into a high-level platform for fostering student innovation and hands-on ability, featuring broad participation, significant impact, and a wealth of high-quality projects.
