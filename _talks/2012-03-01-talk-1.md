Turn theory into practice by entering one of COMAP's modeling contests. The study of mathematics as its own subject may have started with Pythagoras, but people have been counting as a necessity of everyday life for tens of thousands of years. It follows that mathematics was invented to help us understand and manage the world around us.
COMAPâ€™s international modeling contest opportunities at the middle school, high school, and undergraduate levels challenge students to form, organize, and manage a team to model and solve a real-world application problem and present a solution report. In addition, such contests provide an experience in which students develop interpersonal skills through teamwork, develop technical writing and communication skills, feel a sense of accomplishment, and earn an impressive resume credential.
