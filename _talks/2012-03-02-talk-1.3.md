Challenge Cup is the abbreviation of the “Challenge Cup” National College Students’ Science and Technology Competition, a national extracurricular academic and practical competition for college students co-sponsored by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the China Association for Science and Technology, the Ministry of Education, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the All-China Federation of Universities. There are two parallel programs under the Challenge Cup series in China: the “Challenge Cup” National Extracurricular Academic and Technological Works Competition for College Students and the “Challenge Cup” China College Students’ Entrepreneurship Plan Competition. These two national competitions are held alternately, with each program taking place once every two years.
